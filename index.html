        <p>It starts with precision. Every note is played exactly as written, music is something to be followed, not felt. But something shifts. A violinist lingers too long. A trumpet exhales a note that isnâ€™t there. A cellist forgets the bow and listens instead.</p>
        <p>One by one, they stop obeying and start breaking the rules. The orchestra rewrites itself. The song breaks open, reshapes, turns into something else. At first, the audience hesitates. Then they stop trying to understand. They just listen.</p>
        <p><em>Listen with your eyes closed. Let it pull you under.</em></p>
